# 🚀 About Me

I’m a Backend Engineer with strong DevOps experience, focused on building and operating scalable microservices in cloud-native environments.

I design, build, and operate:
- Scalable microservices
- Cloud-native systems on AWS + Kubernetes
- High-performance APIs
- Automation-driven infrastructure
- Production-grade CI/CD platforms

Currently working in production environments where I:
- Run large-scale systems
- Improve reliability & performance
- Build cloud-native backend services
- Automate infrastructure and deployments

# 🧠 Backend Engineering Focus

I specialize in designing and building scalable backend systems that power high-performance applications.

Core strengths:
- Designing REST APIs and microservices using Spring Boot
- Building distributed systems with strong reliability
- Optimizing performance and database queries
- Implementing authentication, RBAC, and secure service communication
- Deploying backend services on cloud-native infrastructure

I enjoy solving backend problems related to:
- API latency & throughput
- Database performance
- Service scalability
- Fault tolerance
- System reliability

# ⚙️ Backend + DevOps Strength

I not only build backend services — I also deploy, scale, and operate them in production environments.

This allows me to:
- Design services with scalability in mind
- Build CI/CD pipelines for reliable releases
- Run backend systems on AWS + Kubernetes
- Improve performance, monitoring, and uptime
- Own services end-to-end from development to deployment
